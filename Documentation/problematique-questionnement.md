# IDEA: to explore the structuring of a literary field marked by struggles for social recognition, cultural and symbolic capital, and the historical conditions of production (slavery, segregation, civil rights movements)

## The information available on Wikipedia generally includes:

1. educational and professional background

2. membership in literary, social or political movements

3. relations with other authors and institutions

4. main works published and their reception

## Some possible research questions:

1. What types of trajectories lead to literary recognition among African-American writers?

2. How do social and geographical origins influence their careers?

3. Which networks, organizations, or movements (literary, political, academic) appear as key supports in their careers?

4. Do we observe significant differences across generations of writers (e.g., before and after the 1960s)?
