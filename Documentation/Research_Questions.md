# IDEA: to explore the structuring of a literary field marked by struggles for social recognition, cultural and symbolic capital, and the historical conditions of production (slavery, segregation, civil rights movements)

* Studying African-American writers through a prosopographical approach is especially interesting because this population is shaped by historically unequal access to education, publishing institutions, and public recognition, while also being strongly structured by collective movements and networks (abolitionism, Harlem Renaissance, Black Arts Movement, civil rights activism, historically Black colleges and universities, writers’ organizations, etc.). Prosopography lets us move beyond “great author” narratives by comparing systematically individual trajectories (social origins, geography, schooling, occupations, affiliations, prizes, and publication pathways) to identify recurrent patterns and constraints. This makes it possible to test questions such as: what typical pathways lead to literary recognition; how origins and mobility shape careers; which organizations, movements, and institutions function as key supports; and whether generational breaks (e.g., before vs. after the 1960s) correspond to changes in education, affiliations, and forms of symbolic capital within the literary field.

## The information available on Wikipedia generally includes

1. educational and professional background

2. membership in literary, social or political movements

3. relations with other authors and institutions

4. main works published and their reception

## Some possible research questions

1. What types of trajectories lead to literary recognition among African-American writers?

2. How do social and geographical origins influence their careers?

3. Which networks, organizations, or movements (literary, political, academic) appear as key supports in their careers?

4. Do we observe significant differences across generations of writers (e.g., before and after the 1960s)?

5. What patterns can we observe in the education, affiliations, and recognition of African-American writers from 1900 to today?
